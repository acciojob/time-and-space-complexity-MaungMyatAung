	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
    <p>Time complexity is a computational concept that describes the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the length of the input. It is essential to analyze time complexity to ensure that algorithms are efficient and can handle large inputs effectively.</p>
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses in relation to the input size. It is crucial to consider space complexity, especially in scenarios where memory usage is a concern. For example, an algorithm with a space complexity of O(n) means that the memory required grows linearly with the input size.</p>
